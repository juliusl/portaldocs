### Editor

Editor control in the FX SDK is a wrapper for the "Monaco" editor which supports various languages, syntax highligting, intellisense, real-time syntax checking and validation.

#### Editor Basics

To use the editor, compose a part that hosts the editor control, then use it from your extension.

You can control the behavior and features of the editor via initialization `options`.

**Step 1**: Define the Html template for your part:

`\Client\V1\Controls\Editor\Templates\EditorInstructions.html`

**Step 2**: Create a viewmodel to bind your control to. SampleEditorViewModel implements the viewmodel for the editor.

`\Client\V1\Controls\Editor\ViewModels\EditorViewModels.ts.`

{"gitdown":"include-section","file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Controls/Editor/ViewModels/EditorViewModels.ts","section":"editor#sampleEditorViewModel"}

**Step 3**: Now you can consume your part from an extension by referencing it in the PDL:

`\Client\V1\Controls\Editor\Editor.pdl`

{"gitdown":"include-section","file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Controls/Editor/Editor.pdl","section":"editor#custompart"}

#### Editor with Custom Language

Custom language can be used by declaring inherited Editor control viewmodel with rules and suggestions.

**Step 1**: Define the Html template for your part:

`\Client\V1\Controls\Editor\Templates\CustomLanguageEditor.html`

**Step 2**: Create a viewmodel to bind your control to. SampleEditorViewModel implements the viewmodel for the editor.

`\Client\V1\Controls\Editor\ViewModels\CustomLanguageEditorViewModels.ts.`

{"gitdown":"include-section","file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Controls/Editor/ViewModels/CustomLanguageEditorViewModels.ts","section":"editor#sampleCustomLanguageEditorViewModel"}

**Step 3**: Now you can consume your part from an extension by referencing it in the PDL:

`\Client\V1\Controls\Editor\Editor.pdl`

{"gitdown":"include-section","file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Controls/Editor/Editor.pdl","section":"editor#customlanguagepart"}
